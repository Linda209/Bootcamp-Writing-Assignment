My name is Linda goodboy I am coming from a small village called Emseni I don’t remember much about Emseni because I left there when I was very young but I always here the great stories
I was raised by parents that really value the hard work and commitment I remember when I was in primary school I use to play with my father and he was the one that was helping me with homework’s
In primary, the other kids called me "Ngozi" because of the scar in my forehead. I remember coming home crying. My dad says words that comfort me and making me feel better
I still have a Scar on my forehead, but I've long since become comfortable with it. I think I learned early to accept myself physically,

I didn’t have lot of friends when I was young the only friends that I have was school friends, we used to play soccer during break time and I was always losing my school shoes and when I came back home my mom gave discipline to take care of my shoes when I am playing at school and promise me that she can’t buy me new school shoes but she ended up buying me new shoes course she knew that I was young and doing mistakes
