I’m interested in programming because I have a passion for technology creativity and finding solutions. I love the mental challenge that programming presents I like to be a coder because I am able to  put my thoughts into reality one of most satisfying aspects of the job as a programmer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system I remember my first line of code I wrote to print hello world using java it was such a great experience  to see the code running I enjoy cording because you learn lot of things each an everyday. My first year at university I was already knew few basic things about I.T and I use to help students that were struggling because some of them was ‘not even exposed to Technology due to their backgrounds and I realized that by helping peoples you gain some knowledge as well
