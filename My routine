I am flexible I am comfort in working anytime but I prefer the most working at night because it is very peacefully and quite but it depend on the situation .I can be able to handle pressure but I prefer to do things early so that I can be able to recheck my work several times and modify it to make it perfect 
But it depend on the situation for example on my final year at university we was writing and doing project at the sometime so I was starting with studying and doing the project late maybe around 10 course I prefer my mind to be fresh when I am studying so that I can be able to have clear understanding
