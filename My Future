One of my lectures told us that your I.T qualification it is useless if it not help peoples around you Even though I havenâ€™t got a permanent good job for now but I think my basic technical skills help peoples around me for example I help peoples in my community when they have issues with their windows, Microsoft office even though it not a lot of work but I consider it as helping people
My family especially my mom she is always wanting what best for me she have been very supportive through out my career and there is no way I can pay her but my plan is to show her that I understand and I appreciate her. My mom is a person that can sacrifices everything so that her children can be successful and have a better education.
