 My mother she have garden with different vegetable Spinach,onion, Tomato and I enjoy helping her take care of them. It is a pleasure to feel the soil remove the weeds and do the little things that help the plants grow better. I also watch movies especially romantic comedy movies
In the night, I usually do a bit of reading before going to bed. Books are like little treasure chests. A lot of information and knowledge are to be found in them and all it takes is a bit of time spent reading them. This is certainly a very beneficial way to spend my free time
