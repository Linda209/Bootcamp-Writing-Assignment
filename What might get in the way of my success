I am a very shy person I get nervous when I am presenting in front of peoples but I overcome that weakness by being fully prepared before I go to the presentation.
I prepare myself by rehearsing in front of my friend before delivering it in front of the actual audience

When ever I am working on multiple projects I end up loosing concentration on other project I am struggling in handling the load of work  
I Overcoming the weakness by setting daily goals that will help me complete major projects and then mark off the days I meet my goals on a printed calendar that 
will help me to avoid procrastination in the things that I want to accomplish
