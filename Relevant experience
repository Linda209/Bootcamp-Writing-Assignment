In final year at university we were told to create the project so with my team we designed a mobile application using android (Xamarin) .the purpose of the project was to allow the passengers to purchase the train trips using a mobile application and those trips was supposed to be stored into the smart card and the passenger can only just scan the smart card if he/she have enough funds (tokens) in the smart card to get access into the train and if there are any delays the admin can be able to send notification to the user mobile application to notify them about the delays
In my final year I did in-service training at Guest Printer Services where I was assigned to develop a mobile application and configure it to the printer so that the user can be able to send documents in the printer using mobile application but I was most focused on the front-end. Working at GPS gave an opportunity to have experience in the working environment and to meet different skilled technicians
